<h1>AKS Baseline Cluster for Regulated Workloads</h1>

<p>
    To demonstrate the zero-trust network infrastructure in place, this web frontend has kicked off a
    series of web requests both within and external to the cluster. Most of the traffic will be blocked
    by the zero-trust network in place -- only specific traffic will be allowed. This traffic flow is
    managed by a combination of service mesh rules (layer 7), Kubernetes NetworkPolicies (layer 3/4), Azure
    NSGs (layer 3/4), and Azure Firewall rules with many rules overlapping for defense-in-depth.
</p>
<p>
    Not visualized here is that all of the in-cluster, service-to-service communication is being performed via
    mTLS and using Kuberentes service authentication to establish trust relationships. All of the
    <code>http://microservice-*</code> calls are rewritten as a TLS connection by the mesh before traversing
    the cluster's network.
</p>
<p>
    All internal and external network flows are <strong>denied by default</strong>. The following are the allowed
    in-cluster network flows. <strong>All flows validate TLS trust chain and require SNI.</strong>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>✔️ Your Kubernetes ingress controller can only receive traffic from Azure Application Gateway.</li>
        <li>✔️ Your Kubernetes ingress controller can contact this <code>web-frontend</code>, but only on its <code>web</code> port. [<i>cross-namespace call</i>]</li>
        <li>✔️ <code>web-frontend</code> can contact <code>microservice-a</code>, but only on the <code>/URLCaller/depth/.+</code> route. [<i>cross-namespace call</i>]</li>
        <li>✔️ <code>microservice-a</code> can contact <code>microservice-b</code>, but only on the <code>/URLCaller/depth/.+</code> route.</li>
        <li>✔️ <code>microservice-b</code> can contact <code>microservice-c</code>, but only on the <code>/URLCaller/depth/.+</code> route. [<i>cross-namespace call</i>]</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Allowed external network flows are the following.
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>✔️ <code>microservice-a</code> can contact <code>https://packages.microsoft.com</code>.</li>
